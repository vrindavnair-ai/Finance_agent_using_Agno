# Finance_agent_using_Agno
This is a basic Finance agent using Agno done by taking inspiration from the session by Decoding Data Science.

It uses Finance Tool and Web tool.
I have made it using Gemini model.
But you can uncomment the openAI parts in the code and use your open AI api to call open AI model.
Made the interface with gradio
